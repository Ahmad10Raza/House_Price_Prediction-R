# House_Price_Prediction-R


## **Description:**
* **House price prediction is the process of using data to estimate the value of a house. This can be done for a variety of reasons, such as to determine the value of a home for sale, to assess the risk of a mortgage, or to make investment decisions.**
* There are a variety of different methods that can be used to predict house prices. Some of the most common methods include:

* **Linear regression:** This is a simple method that uses a straight line to predict the value of a house.
* **Random forest:** This is a more complex method that uses a group of decision trees to make predictions.
* **Gradient boosting:** This is a technique that combines multiple models to make predictions.
* **The accuracy of house price prediction models can vary depending on the quality of the data and the method that is used. However, these models can be a valuable tool for making informed decisions about the housing market.**
